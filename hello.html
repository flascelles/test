        <h1>The Lost Treasure of Kamehameha</h1>
        <p>omg</p>
        <h3>Did you know that 1,500 years ago: Polynesians arrive in Hawaii after navigating the ocean using only the stars to guide them? Or did they just get lucky? Anyhoo, in 1778 Captain James Cook lands at Waimea Bay on the island of Kauai, becoming the first European to make contact with the Hawaiian Islands. In 1810 Kamehameha became Hawaii's first king. The islands continued to have royal rulers into the 1880s. In 1898 Hawaii became a U.S. territory.</h3>

        <h3>When the Americans took over, Kamehameha secretly sought refuge in the Okanagan</h3>
        <h3>You have been chosen to claim the lost treasure of Kamehameha. The first clue is located at the first lookout of Know Mountain. There, look for the firestorm display sign. The clue is hidden under it.</h3>
        <h3>Hurry!</h3>
