        <h1>The Lost Treasure of Kamehameha</h1>
        <h3>Did you know that 1,500 years ago: Polynesians arrive in Hawaii after navigating the ocean using only the stars to guide them. 1778: Captain James Cook lands at Waimea Bay on the island of Kauai, becoming the first European to make contact with the Hawaiian Islands. In 1810 Kamehameha became Hawaii's first king. The islands continued to have royal rulers into the 1880s. In 1898 Hawaii became a U.S. territory.</h3>
        <h3>To redeem your amazing present, you must go on a hunt to find Kamehameha’s lost treasure. The first clue is located at the first lookout of Know Mountain. There, look for the firestorm display sign. The clue is hidden under it.</h3>
